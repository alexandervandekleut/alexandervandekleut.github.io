    "# Gym Wrappers\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will be learning about the extremely powerful feature of **wrappers** made available to us courtesy of OpenAI's `gym`. Wrappers will allow us to add functionality to environments, such as modifying observations and rewards to be fed to our agent. It is common in reinforcement learning to preprocess observations in order to make them more easy to learn from. A common example is when using image-based inputs, to ensure that all values are between $0$ and $1$ rather than between $0$ and $255$, as is more common with RGB images.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `gym.Wrapper` class inherits from the `gym.Env` class, which defines environments according to the OpenAI API for reinforcement learning. Implementing the `gym.Wrapper` class requires defining an `__init__` method that accepts the environment to be extended as a parameter."
