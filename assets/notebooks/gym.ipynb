    "# Introduction to the OpenAI Gym Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI has been developing the `gym` library to help reinforcement learning researchers get started with pre-implemented environments. In the lesson on Markov decision processes, we explicitly implemented $\\mathcal{S}, \\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{P}$ and $\\mathcal{R}$ using matrices and tensors in `numpy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the **environment** and **agent** that we discussed in the introduction. When we specified an MDP and a policy, we were abstractly representing the environment and the agent. `gym` gives us access to predefined environments that are more meaningful than our essentially random environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus far we have been using **discrete** observation spaces (i.e., our state is representable by an integer). In keeping with this, we will start by considering a `gym` environment that also has a discrete observation space.\n",
    "\n",
    "From [the documentation](https://gym.openai.com/envs/FrozenLake-v0/):\n",
    "> The agent controls the movement of a character in a grid world. Some tiles of the grid are walkable, and others lead to the agent falling into the water. Additionally, the movement direction of the agent is uncertain and only partially depends on the chosen direction. The agent is rewarded for finding a walkable path to a goal tile.\n",
    "\n",
    "The grid is $4 \\times 4$, giving us a total of $16$ states.\n",

    "We can inspect information about `gym` environments. Every environment has an `observation_space` (corresponding to $\\mathcal{S}$) and an `action_space` (corresponding to $\\mathcal{A}$). There are many categories of $spaces$ available, but the two that are most common and most important are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Discrete`: When observation spaces or action spaces are discrete, they expect integers. This is what we used in our notebook on Markov decision processes.\n",
    "    - Every `Discrete` space has an attribute `n` corresponding to the number of discrete elements in the space (i.e., number of states or number of actions).\n",
    "2. `Box`: Some observations or action spaces instead take on real values, and can be of various shapes.\n",
    "    - Every `Box` space has an attribute `shape` corresponding to the dimensions of the space. For example, an observation space with shape $(84, 84, 3)$ might correspond to an $84 \\times 84 \\times 3$ RGB image."
